# CPA on ChaCha

This is a implementation of a Correlation Power Analaysis on the ChaCha cipher
based on the paper [Don't Fall into a Trap: Physical Side-Channel Analysis of
ChaCha20-Poly1305](https://past.date-conference.com/proceedings-archive/2017/pdf/7031.pdf)
using the [ChipWhisperer](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer)-Lite.

As I've developed this project in my study, a German [documentation](doc/) is
available.
